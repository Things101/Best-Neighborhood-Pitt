An examination of three metrics find the “best” neighborhood in Pittsburgh. The metrics we use are number of arrests, number of fires, and number of vehicles over the speed limit. See the Final Notebook file for our report or see the separate notebooks for detailed information on each metric. The datasets that were used are, for each metric respectively, [here](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/arrest-data), [here](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/fire-incidents-in-city-of-pittsburgh), and [here](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/traffic-count-data-city-of-pittsburgh).
